The authenticated user who is having access to the key provided by owner for particular file can download that file in original decrypted form. Validations are provided for sign up and login pages of owner and users.The database is created in MySQL to store and modify the data. Identity of the user is protected from cloud during authentication. Packages such as Tkinter for GUI, Mysql connector for database connectivity and cryptocipher for encryption are used in this scheme. This scheme is developed in Python 3.6 with IDLE as an integrated development environment.
